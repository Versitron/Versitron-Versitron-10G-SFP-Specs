## ST Connector 10GB SFP Alternative

**LC-based optical modules as modern alternatives to legacy ST connectors.**

- ST connectors use a bayonet design—reliable but bulkier and less dense  
- LC connectors offer smaller form factors, ideal for high-density 10G applications  
- Versitron’s LC SFP modules deliver easier handling and higher port density  
- Optional adapters available for ST-to-LC conversion if required  

Upgrade from ST-style connections to **Versitron LC-based SFP modules** for improved performance, space efficiency, and simplified cable management.

## Full Duplex Fiber Module

**Simultaneous two-way optical data transmission for high-speed networks.**

- Transmits and receives data simultaneously over two fiber strands  
- Maximizes throughput and minimizes latency for mission-critical systems  
- Compatible with switches, routers, and media converters supporting full duplex  
- Ideal for enterprise backbones, telecom systems, and data center networks  

Versitron’s **full duplex fiber modules** ensure efficient bidirectional communication with no data collision or interruption.

## Single Strand 10GB SFP

**Efficient single-fiber transmission using BiDi (bidirectional) technology.**

- Uses one fiber strand with dual wavelengths (Tx/Rx) for both directions  
- Reduces fiber usage and infrastructure costs  
- Available for ranges up to 40km or more depending on model  
- Ideal for metro networks, FTTH, and limited-fiber environments  

The **Versitron single-strand 10G SFP** provides exceptional bandwidth efficiency—perfect for compact or extended fiber network deployments.
